### Code Refactoring

* **date-picker:** modularize date picker into dedicated libraries ([f19b188](https://github.com/ever-co/ever-capture/commit/f19b1883bc7392e9a42f7342afca689ab24fd029))


* build(libs)!: upgrade Angular to v19 and simplify peer dependencies ([8a519ca](https://github.com/ever-co/ever-capture/commit/8a519ca4c491dfce28d1be34e7680dde4fce1023))


### BREAKING CHANGES

* Peer dependency declarations for numerous libraries
have been significantly reduced.
Most affected libraries now list only `@angular/common` and
`@angular/core` as `peerDependencies`. Previously declared peers
(e.g., `@ngrx/store`, `rxjs`, various `@ever-co/*` packages,
`@angular/material`) have been removed from these libraries'
`peerDependencies`.
Consuming applications must ensure these dependencies are directly
managed if still required. This change aims for greater flexibility
and reduced dependency conflicts but may require project adjustments.
* **date-picker:** Date picker components and state management have been
relocated from `shared-components` and `shared-service`.
`CopyContextButtonComponent` and `ToggleComponent` have been removed
from `shared-components`.
Migration:
- Update imports for `DatePickerComponent` to `@ever-co/date-picker-feature`.
- Update imports for date picker NgRx state to
`@ever-co/date-picker-data-access`.
- Replace usage of `DatePickerService` with NgRx selectors/actions from
`@ever-co/date-picker-data-access`.

* **upload:** create upload feature to allow user to see uploading progress ([2d823d6](https://github.com/ever-co/ever-capture/commit/2d823d6aadb5c438f007807370ffbb8850b543a9))

### BREAKING CHANGES

* **upload:** The Ngrx store for uploads has been completely refactored:
- `uploadFeatureKey` changed from 'upload' to 'uploadQueue'.
- The state structure is now item-based (managing lists for `queue`,
`inProgress`, `completed`, `failed`, `canceled`, `activeUploads`)
replacing the previous global upload status.
- Actions like `uploadActions.uploadVideos` are replaced by
`uploadActions.addItemToQueue({ item: new UploadVideoItem(video) })`
or `uploadActions.addItemToQueue({ items: [...] })`.
- Selectors like `selectUploadState.uploading` are deprecated. Use new
selectors such as `selectUploadInProgress` (boolean),
`selectInProgress` (list of items), `selectCanUploadMore`, etc.
The global `UploadProgressComponent` snackbar previously managed by
`LayoutComponent` has been removed. Upload status is now primarily
managed through the new `UploadBadgeComponent` and `UploadQueueComponent`.
The `UploadProgressComponent` itself has been repurposed to display
progress for a single `IUploadItem` (passed as an `@Input()`) and is
used within the `UploadQueueComponent`.
The `UploaderService.cancel()` method now requires an `itemId` parameter.
The data payload for IPC events `Channel.UPLOAD_PROGRESS`,
`Channel.UPLOAD_DONE`, and `Channel.UPLOAD_ERROR` has changed. They
now emit objects containing an `itemId` and conform to the new
`IUploadProgress`, `IUploadDone`, and `IUploadError` interfaces
respectively.
